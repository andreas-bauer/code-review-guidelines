# Code Review Guidelines for GUI-based Testing

The review of software artifacts, such as source or test code, is a common industrial practice. However, although review guidelines are available for source and low-level test code, such guidelines are missing for GUI-based testing artifacts.

The goal of this work is to define a set of guidelines from literature about production and test code, that can be mapped to GUI-based testing artifacts.

## Sources

The guidelines are based on the findings of the following academic studies:
